    length(r)

`length` is a generic operator for finding the length of various objects in the system. The meaning depends on the type of the object. In particular, the length of an algebraic expression is the number of additive top-level terms its expanded representation.

*Examples:*
```Julia
julia> length(:(a+b))
2

julia> length(2)
1
```
Other objects that support a length operator include arrays, lists and matrices. The explicit meaning in these cases is included in the description of these objects.

    rlet(::Union{Dict,Pair})

The simplest use of the `let` statement is in the form
```
R"let ⟨substitution list⟩"
```
where `⟨substitution list⟩` is a list of rules separated by commas, each of the form:
```
⟨variable⟩ = ⟨expression⟩
```
or
```
⟨prefix operator⟩(⟨argument⟩,…,⟨argument⟩) = ⟨expression⟩
```
or
```
⟨argument⟩⟨infix operator⟩,…,⟨argument⟩ = ⟨expression⟩
```
For example,
```
        let {x => y^2,
             h(u,v) => u - v,
             cos(pi/3) => 1/2,
             a*b => c,
             l+m => n,
             w^3 => 2*z - 3,
             z^10 => 0}
```
The list brackets can be left out if preferred. The above rules could also have been entered as seven separate `let` statements.

After such `let` rules have been input, `x` will always be evaluated as the square of `y`, and so on. This is so even if at the time the `let` rule was input, the variable `y` had a value other than `y`. (In contrast, the assignment `R"x:=y^2"` will set `x` equal to the square of the current value of `y`, which could be quite different.)

The rule `let a*b=c` means that whenever `a` and `b` are both factors in an expression their product will be replaced by `c`. For example, `a^5*b^7*w` would be replaced by `c^5*b^2*w`.

The rule for `l+m` will not only replace all occurrences of `l+m` by `n`, but will also normally replace `l` by `n-m`, but not `m` by `n-l`. A more complete description of this case is given in Section 11.2.5.

The rule pertaining to `w^3` will apply to any power of `w` greater than or equal to the third.

Note especially the last example, `let z^10=0`. This declaration means, in effect: ignore the tenth or any higher power of `z`. Such declarations, when appropriate, often speed up a computation to a considerable degree. (See Section 11.4 for more details.)

Any new operators occurring in such `let` rules will be automatically declared `operator` by the system, if the rules are being read from a file. If they are being entered interactively, the system will ask `Declare… Operator?`. Answer `Y` or `N` and hit `<Return>`.

In each of these examples, substitutions are only made for the explicit expressions given; i.e., none of the variables may be considered arbitrary in any sense. For example, the command
```Julia
julia> Algebra.rlet( :(h(u,v)) => :(u - v) )
```
will cause `h(u,v)` to evaluate to `u - v`, but will not affect `h(u,z)` or `h` with any arguments other than precisely the symbols `u,v`.

These simple `let` rules are on the same logical level as assignments made with the `:=` operator. An assignment `R"x := p+q"` cancels a rule `rlet( :x => :(y^2) )` made earlier, and vice versa.

For example, with `R"setmod 3"` and `R"on modular"`, the polynomial `(a+2*b)^3` would become `a^3+2*n^3`.

    nullspace(exprn)

Syntax:
```
        NULLSPACE(EXPRN:matrix_expression):list
```
`nullspace` calculates for a matrix `a` a list of linear independent vectors (a basis) whose linear combinations satisfy the equation \$Ax = 0\$. The basis is provided in a form such that as many upper components as possible are isolated.

Note that with `b := nullspace a` the expression `length b` is the *nullity* of `a`, and that `second length a - length b` calculates the *rank* of `a`. The rank of a matrix expression can also be found more directly by the `rank` operator described below.

*Example:* The command
```
        nullspace mat((1,2,3,4),(5,6,7,8));
```
gives the output
```
        {  
         [ 1  ]  
         [ 0  ]  
         [ - 3]  
         [ 2  ]  
         ,  
         [ 0  ]  
         [ 1  ]  
         [ - 2]  
         [ 1  ]  
         }
```
In addition to the REDUCE matrix form, `nullspace` accepts as input a matrix given as a list of lists, that is interpreted as a row matrix. If that form of input is chosen, the vectors in the result will be represented by lists as well. This additional input syntax facilitates the use of `nullspace` in applications different from classical linear algebra.

    rank(exprn)

Syntax:
```
        RANK(EXPRN:matrix_expression):integer
```
`rank` calculates the rank of its argument, that, like `nullspace` can either be a standard matrix expression, or a list of lists, that can be interpreted either as a row matrix or a set of equations.

*Example:*
```Julia
Algebra.rank([:a :b :c; :d :e :f])
```
returns the value `2`.
