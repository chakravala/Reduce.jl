> The production of this version of the manual has been the result of the contributions of a large number of individuals who have taken the time and effort to suggest improvements to previous versions, and to draft new sections. Particular thanks are due to Gerry Rayna, who provided a draft rewrite of most of the first half of the manual. Other people who have made significant contributions have included John Fitch, Martin Griss, Stan Kameny, Jed Marti, Herbert Melenk, Don Morrison, Arthur Norman, Eberhard Schrüfer, Larry Seward and Walter Tietze. Finally, Richard Hitt produced a TeX version of the REDUCE 3.3 manual, which has been a useful guide for the production of the LaTeX version of this manual.
